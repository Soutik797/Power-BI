# Power-BI


I developed 2 interactive Power BI reports to visualize and analyze key business data, leveraging the support of AI tools such as ChatGPT for guidance and optimization. The reports were designed to provide insights into trends, performance metrics, and operational efficiency. With the help of AI, I was able to enhance data modeling, optimize DAX formulas, and create impactful visuals that enable faster decision-making. These reports are user-friendly, scalable, and support drill-down capabilities for in-depth analysis. The integration of AI significantly improved development speed, accuracy, and creativity throughout the project.
